# 1 Risk Identification

## 1.1 Definition

A risk is defined as an event or condition that could impact the ability of the project to meet it's objectives.

## 1.2 Categories

The potential risk categories that could impact the project are:

* Requirements
* Time management
* Quality
* Issues
* Communication
* Resource

## 1.3 Risks

| Requirements | <ul><li>Requirements aren't clearly defined</li><li>Requirements don't meet the user's needs</li></ul> | 1.1 <br /> 1.2|
| Time management |  <ul><li>Developers underestimate the time needed to code the project</li><li>Not provided sufficient time to complete the project</li></ul> | 2.1 <br /> 2.2 |

# 2 Risk Quantification

## 2.1 Likelihood

| Title        | Score           | Description  |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Very Low | 20 | Highly unlikely to occur; however, still needs to be monitored as certain circumstances could result in this risk becoming more likely to occur during the project |
| Low | 40 | Unlikely to occur, based on current information, as the circumstances likely to trigger the risk are also unlikely to occur ||
| Medium | 60 | Likely to occur as it is clear that the risk will probably eventuate |
| High | 80 | Very likely to occur, based on the circumstances of the project |
| Very High | 100 | Highly likely to occur as the circumstances which will cause this risk to eventuate are also very likely to be created |

## 2.2 Impact

| Title        | Score           | Description  |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Very Low | 20 | Insignificant impact on the project. It is not possible to measure the impact on the project as it is minimal |
| Low | 40 | Minor impact on the project ||
| Medium | 60 | Measurable impact on the project |
| High | 80 | Significant impact on the project |
| Very High | 100 | Major impact on the project |

## 2.3 Priority

Priority = (Likelihood + Impact) / 2

# 4 Risk Process

## 4.1 Purpose

The purpose of risk management is to take into consideration any risks that may arise throughout the project and think of ways in which to prevent risks and how to deal with any that occur. The group discussed potential risks and then came up with a plan for rectifying any risks that may take place.
