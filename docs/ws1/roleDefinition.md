# Role Definitions

##Quality Assurer (Tester):

This is a role that is designed for finding errors within the project in order to ensure they are not present in the final product. They will use techniques that include writing and running scripts that test the system but they will also key in data and play around with the system to make sure it functions as planned. The QA team is responsible for making sure the system meets the requirements of the system.

The QA team will gather the scripts and test cases and form a test plan. It will be a simple document that provides an overview of each of the test cases. The scripts and test cases are also used to make sure that there are no unexpected errors in the system.

A test case is general-purpose statement that maps requirements and design points. It is the overall functionality that is being tested. Test scripts are step by step instructions on what to do, what to look out for and what should happen. Test scripts are specific to how the problem was solved by the software development team and will require understanding of the software.

You can split the role into three different parts:

- The role creates test scripts and test cases.
- The role supervises the execution of the test scripts and cases
- The role carries out random tests to make sure that there are no random bugs in the system.

There is also research involved in the role, they will need to research and find already existing technologies that could be applied to the current project.

They will also help guide and motivate the development team. The development team will need to understand the technologies being put forward by the SA and the SA will need to understand the current state of the project to see what new technologies they need.
