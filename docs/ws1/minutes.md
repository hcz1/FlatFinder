**FDM case study breakdown and analysis**

All members were firstly introduced to each other, then all the members read the Flat Finder case study which was provided by the client FDM. After everyone read and understood the case study as a group we highlighted the key aspect of the case study. This allowed us to understand the key requirements and get a clear understand of  the desired end product.

**Generating questions for FDM interview**

Once we understood the case study as a group we came up with questions which were not answered in the case study such as the follows:

1.  How would the user express interest in being a buddy?
2.  What criteria would it suggest buddyâ€™s for you?
3. 	How would you search for a property i.e. using Postcode, City?
4.  Is one email allowed to be used for a Landlord and Searcher account?

We made sure we asked open question to get as much detail possible and that the questions were related to requirements. Jordan documented all the questions and then each member were assigned four questions to ask in the interview with FDM.
