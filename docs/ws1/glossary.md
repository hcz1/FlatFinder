#Initial Project Glossary - FlatFinder

##Technical Terms

**Agile** - In context of software engineering, agile refers to a specific set of software development methodologies in which software is produced in incremental parts. Agile development puts a strong emphasis on collaboration between designers, developers, testers and end-users in addition to continuous planning, testing and integration.

**Encryption** - Is a method of enhancing the security of a password or message by scrambling data to the extent it cannot be read by anyone except for a person with access to the secret key.

**Requirement** - A necessary documented feature of a system. Requirements are also priorised in order of importance and may be dependent upon one another.

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language complementing the markup language HTML. CSS allows developers/designers to have control over how content is displayed to an end user accessing the service through an internet based browser.

**HTML** - HyperText Markup Language is the primary language used to create web pages on the World Wide Web. HTML is used by developers to define the structure of a web page through the utilisation of tags which informs the browser how to structure a web page. HTML is capable of expressing simple layouts and minimal aesthetical features of a web page; however, CSS is primarily used due to its heirarchical nature and high reusability. 

**Scrum** - Scrum is an agile methodology which focuses on iterative and incremental development of software systems. Scrum allows developers to backtrack and change components of a system without diminishing project goals and milestones. 

**GitHub** - Is a web-based version control system. It allows multiple developers to work on a single project by allowing them to store and retrieve project files from the same source simultaneously.

**JPEG** - Joint Photographic Experts Group or JPEG is a lossy image format. JPEG images can be of a lower quality than their Portable Network Graphics or PNG counterpart, but are generally smaller in size due to the loss of quality during compression.

**Configuration Management** - Is a thorough and descriptive recording and updating of information that describes a project; more specifically, how it should be managed, maintained and produced.

**PNG** - Portable Network Graphics is a lossless image format. Due to lossless data compression the image quality is generally better than JPEG and GIF. This also means that the image file sizes are bigger.

**API** - An Application Programming Interface is a set of programming routines and protocols that enable the reuse of third party software services. 

**Java** - The main implementation language used to implement the system. Java will be used for cross-platform compatibility. 

**JavaScript** - Is a dynamic and untyped programming language used to develop modern websites commonly alongside HTML and CSS. Its provides a solution for producing interactive client side web pages.

**MySQL** - Is a relational database management language used to store data which needs to be persisted such as login or property details within a database. 

**Gradle** - Is an open source build system which alleviates concerns primarily regarding project software dependencies.

**Cucumber**- Is a tool used by developers for testing software. Cucumber runs automated tests written in a behavior-driven development style. 

**UML** - Unified Modeling Language is a notational language used to visualise and specify complex software systems.

**HTTP** - HyperText Transfer Protocol is an underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web. The protocol is used to define how messages are transmitted and formatted.

**HTTPS** - Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol is an additional layer of HTTP which adds security to the transmission of web pages and data. It utilises a public/private key cryptography system in order to secure transmitted data.

**Graphical User Interface** - A system's graphical user interface is the visual component of the software/service that enables users to interact with the system.

##Non Technical Terms

**User** - Within the context of this project, a user strictly refers to end-users of the system; these are the landlords, searchers and administrators. 

**Landlords** - A type of user account that enables users to advertise their property. Landlords can upload key information regarding a property they are attempting to let out. This information includes, but is not limited to; price per month, price per week, number of rooms, dimensions of individual rooms, floor plans, availability dates, addresses and general information about the locality. Landlord accounts are also able to upload images of their property. Unlike searchers, landlords do not have the ability to browse for available properties.

**Searchers** - A type of user account that enables users to search the website for available property. Searchers are able to search for properties put up for let by landlords. Searchers have the ability to search using the following criteria; start and end date, price range and accommodation. Search results display a geographical representation of the property's locality. This map shows the distance between the accommodations to work and university. Additionally, searchers will be able to see public transport routes and local amenities. Searchers have the ability to express interest in properties and to also buddy-up with other searchers. 

**Administrator** - A type of user account used to monitor the content generated by users of the software system.  Administrators can receive reports and take various actions they deem appropriate. Administrators can permanently or temporarily suspend users they deem are using the system in inappropriate or abusive ways. 

**Verification** - Users must register with a valid email address and confirm it before being able to use the system. Verification is used to recover lost passwords. 

**Password Policy** - The password policy is a list of predetermined rules that must be followed in order to successfully choose a password. The password must be at least 8 characters in length.

**Report** - A feature implemented to notify administrators of malicious, incorrect, inappropriate or any type of misuse of the system.

**OpenStreetMap** - Is an open source service/api used within the FlatFinder project to identify and display properties geographically. 

**Search Criteria** - Searchers can filter search results by specifying a start and end date, price range and a postcode for their accommodation. 
	
**User Preferences** - These are used in identifying potential 'buddies' of a Searcher account as well as allowing all users to customise their experience whilst utilising the service. 

**Expressing Interest** - As a user holding a 'Searcher' account type you are granted the ability to view properties and express interest. Expressing interest in a property does not obligate searchers into committing to a property but is rather intended to let landlords know a searcher has generated interest in their property. This can however allow searchers and landlords to open up a medium of communication and set up possible viewings and agreements.

**Buddying Up** - Searchers can buddy up with other searchers in order to possibly co-rent a property. Upon initial, sign up users are prompted whether they're interested in potential buddying. It is possible for searchers to change this afterwards. 

**Software Architecture** - Process of designing a structured solution that meets all the requirements.
