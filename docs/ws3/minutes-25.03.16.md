All the members agreed and thought it was a good idea. Jordan said that we should invest time into the front end of the application as we just had simple HTML. Carl said we could use bootstrap as it makes the web app responsive to mobiles and other devices. All members decided to use bootstrap and Jordon said he will handle the front end.
