### How will issues be fixed?

We have set aside time at the end of the project to fix issues that are found through the testing phase.

##### Cucumber Testing

* We will be able to see if the tests pass or fail by using gradle. 
* If they fail then the tester will tell the developer and together they can fix the issue.

##### UI Testing

* We will proof read the site to fix any grammatical errors. This will be done by several people to make sure no one misses any errors.
* To test usability, we will get people who are not in our group to use the site and provide feedback.
