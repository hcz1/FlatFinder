#Sprint 2 Retrospective 
Towards the end of sprint 2 the group disscussed how the project went and how we could improve for future project and even went on to say what we would do in the next sprint if we had one. We disscussed three major points: things what we should start doing, things that we should stop doing and things that we should continue doing. 

What we should have started doing is checking regularly in the group chat how a certain task was going and if anyone needed assistance if they were struggling to complete the task, instead of just waiting until they pushed to GitHub - This would have sped up some tasks and made it easier towards the end of the worksheet.

What we should stop doing is waiting until other people had finished parts of the implementation and then test, instead we should test as they develop the feature.

What we decided we agreed we should continue doing if we had a next sprint, is that the communication we had in the whatsapp gorup chat was good and worked well. Keep using git issues as they helped outline exaclty what needed to be done in the project.

Overall, the sprint went well, although there is room to improve, and the we learnt a lot in regards to how projects like these function in groups.
